# Processing-Visualizer
An audio visualizer made in processing

TO USE FILE INPUT, CREATE A FOLDER CALLED data!!!

You can either use file input (mp3s and wavs) in the data folder, or use a mic input(so it is possible to use desktop sound).
To do this you have to uncomment which one you want to use.
To use the file input, edit line 20 and replace "Name Of File Here" with the name of the desired file name (In quotation marks)
To use Desktop Sounds as a mic input, 
• Right click the speaker icon on the taskbar
• Click Sounds
• Goto recording
• Right click Stero mix and enable and set as defalt device (I dont know if stero mix depends on hardware so it may not show)
